## Creating Illustrations

### Tired of building practice problems in Word or Excel?

Let our chatbot do the work for you. Just describe what you need, and it will create a complete interactive app — with input fields, step-by-step solutions, and graphs.
No more formatting. No coding. No Excel.
Try it now and share it with your students instantly.

**Prompt:**

> Create an app to calculate the dot product of two vectors. Let users enter the magnitude and angle (from the positive x-axis) of each vector. Show the solution detailed steps and plot the vectors.

### Want to show your students how a function behaves — not just tell them?

Skip graphs in PowerPoint or Excel.
Use our chatbot to create interactive visualizations in seconds.
No coding. Just teaching.
Let your students explore functions visually — anytime, anywhere.

**Prompt:**

> Create an app that plots(x^(3.7)+y^(1.5)-5). Let the user input the x and y ranges. Allow the user to hover over the points.

<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}>

### Want your students to visualize motion instead of just solving equations?

Use our chatbot to build interactive physics apps in seconds — with graphs, animations, and step-by-step solutions.
No code. No spreadsheets. Just describe the problem. Perfect for physics educators or students who want to test ideas visually.

**Prompt:**

> Create an app that calculates and plots the trajectory of a projectile. Let the user enter the initial velocity, angle, and height. Show the time of flight, maximum height, and range. Plot the path of the projectile.

<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}>

## Class Interaction Example

### Explained a tricky concept in class and want to check if students really understood it?

Don’t waste time building forms.
Just tell the chatbot what concept to test, and it will generate a custom quiz app that sends student responses directly to your email.
Instant feedback. Fully customized to your lesson.

**Prompt:**

> Create an app that asks students to explain the conditions for equilibrium in 2D. Let them enter their CCID and written answer. When they submit, send their response to xxxxx@ualberta.ca.

<div style={{width: "100%", height: "600px", overflow: "hidden"}}>

## Quiz Examples With Grading

### Want to quiz your students and collect their scores automatically?

With MecSimCalc, you can create an auto-graded app that logs student answers to a shared spreadsheet.
No grading. No Google Forms. Just instant results — and everything saved in one place.

**Prompt:**

> Create a quiz app that asks: ‘What is the moment at midspan for a simply supported beam of 6 m with a 4 kN/m uniform load?’ The student should enter their CCID and answer. The correct answer is –72 kNm. Award 1 mark if the answer is correct. Append the CCID, answer, and score to this Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

</div>

### Need a fast way to test student understanding — and collect their answers?

Let the chatbot build a self-marking quiz app that also stores responses to a Google Sheet or sends them to your email.
Instant quiz. Automatic grading. Results saved.

- [Learn how to use Gsheet in MecSimCalc](https://docs.mecsimcalc.com/advanced-applications/quiz-toolkit#export-results-to-google-sheets)

**Prompt:**

> Create a quiz app that asks: ‘A projectile is launched at 25 m/s at an angle of 40°. What is the maximum height it reaches?’ The student enters their CCID and answer. The correct answer is 12.9 m. Award 1 mark if correct. Append the result to this sheet: [Google Sheet link].
